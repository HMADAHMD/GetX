GetX Controller:


Features:
State Management.
Route Management.
Dependency Management.
Internationalization.
Validation, Storage.

Steps:
-1 Install getx.
-2 To use getx you have to make a class that extends getxcontroller class.
-3 Next we have to give the dependency injection means we have to initialize the class which extends the getxcontroller.
   The step to initialization is a little different from a normal class. Get.put(TapController()).
-4 We can use getX for navigation purposes by converting the materialapp to GetMaterialApp() and
   then using the Get.to(()=> PageName()).
